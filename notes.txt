If you want to use other languages than english or german for the administration interface of Sulu you need to configure them in the config/packages/sulu_admin.yaml file:

sulu_core:
    locales:
        en: English
        de: Deutsch
    translations:
        - en
        - de

Available languages are shown on Crowdin. Afterwards the languages have to be downloaded by running the following command:

docker compose exec php bin/console sulu:admin:download-language
